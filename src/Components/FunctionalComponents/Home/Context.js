import React from "react";

export default function Context() {

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree
                without having to pass props down manually at every level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Context is designed to share data that can be considered
                “global” for a tree of React components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible
                by many components at different nesting levels.
              </li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
